In the last year, we\u2019ve grown our headcount by 100%, hired in 6 new countries; committed to being a <a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/post-covid-19-coinbase-will-be-a-remote-first-company-cdac6e621df7\">remote-first company</a>; established Coinbase as a <a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804\">mission focused company</a>; and recently completed our direct listing and became a <a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/coin-its-only-the-beginning-868fe4e3fa71\">publicly-traded company</a>. Still, it is incredibly early for crypto as a new technology, and we\u2019re in it for the long-haul. That\u2019s why we take extraordinary measures to attract top talent to come build with\u00a0us.</p><p>It\u2019s actually one of our most important values as a company: top talent in every seat. Upholding it requires us to constantly revisit our compensation practices to ensure we\u2019re competitive in the marketplace, an attractive employer for candidates, and that our compensation practices reinforce the culture we want to build. Evolving compensation is not just about appealing to candidates, though; it\u2019s also about taking a hard look at industry norms and innovating to relieve pain points, ensure more equity across the workforce, and improve transparency. So what are we\u00a0doing?</p><h4>Step 1: Increasing our compensation targets</h4><p>Ensuring top talent in every seat requires an investment. In 2019, we made the decision to benchmark ourselves across a highly competitive set of peers and some of the largest tech companies in the world. This was an aggressive move for us at the time, as a small, private start-up. This year we\u2019ve continued our commitment to top talent by further increasing our cash and equity compensation\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the 50th percentile amongst our peers to the 75th\u200a\u2014\u200aacross the entire\u00a0company.</p><h4>Step 2: Eliminating negotiations from the hiring\u00a0process</h4><p>Because our standard offers are world-class, we are officially eliminating negotiations on salary and equity from our recruiting process.</p><p>Anyone who wants to work in crypto belongs and is valued at Coinbase. It doesn\u2019t matter what your background is, where you went to school (or bootcamp), where you\u2019ve worked before, or even what you\u2019ve been paid before. If you pass our bar and are hired to do the same work, you get the same offer as the next candidate for a\u00a0role.</p><p>Traditionally people expect they need to negotiate for the best package after being hired in a new job. Those that do this well tend to be rewarded, and those that don\u2019t lose out. These negotiations can disproportionately leave women and underrepresented minorities behind, and a disparity created early in someone\u2019s career can follow them for decades. We want to do everything we can to ensure that\u2019s not the experience at Coinbase. All employees in the same position, in the same location, receive the same salary and equity offer. No exceptions.</p><p>Eliminating negotiations doesn\u2019t mean all employees are paid the same after they begin working. In fact, we <em>want</em> compensation differentiation, but it should be solely driven by demonstrated performance and outsized impact on our company and for our customers. We will continue to apply multipliers to our equity and cash rewards for high performers identified through our rigorous performance management process. This way, our high performers receive compensation commensurate with their impact, in addition to accelerated career development and a front row seat to building the cryptoeconomy.</p><p>We are OK if we lose some candidates due to this decision\u200a\u2014\u200athe best candidates for Coinbase are those who are looking for a highly competitive package and are ready to let their contributions speak for themselves.</p><h4>Step 3: Adopting annual equity grants that drive predictable, real time compensation</h4><p>Another goal of our new compensation program is to manage volatility and provide as much predictability for our employees as possible. Crypto has historically been volatile, and it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that our stock price may be, too. As we grow, we anticipate more candidates will value predictability in their annual compensation. Instead of a four-year new hire grant (standard at many tech companies), employees will receive annual grants, sized at one-year targets that vest in their entirety each year. An employee\u2019s multi-year equity compensation will no longer be dictated by our company valuation at a single point in\u00a0time.</p><p>Some may say eliminating 4-year new hire grants could hurt retention; we disagree. We don\u2019t want employees to feel locked in at Coinbase based on grants awarded 3 or 4 years prior. We want to earn our employees\u2019 commitment every year and, likewise, expect them to earn their seat at Coinbase.</p><p>We are also eliminating the one-year cliff from our new hire grants. We expect new hires to add value on their first day, so it only makes sense for them to start vesting rewards for their contributions.</p><p>We also plan to make these annual grants for all employees together at one time, using one share price. This is designed to minimize disparate outcomes that can persist for years after one\u2019s start date. This is another way we are ensuring pay differences are due only to demonstrated performance.

Let\u2019s look at a few key data\u00a0points.</p><h3>Myth #1: The majority of cryptocurrency transactions are for illegal activities.</h3><p>The Facts:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.elliptic.co/resources/typologies-concise-guide-crypto-leaders\">Research</a> <a href=\"https://ciphertrace.com/2020-year-end-cryptocurrency-crime-and-anti-money-laundering-report/\">shows</a> that illicit activity accounts for less than 1 percent of transactions.</li><li>Of that small portion, scams make up the <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets\">overwhelming majority</a> of cryptocurrency related crime\u200a\u2014\u200anot money laundering, terrorism, trafficking, or other unlawful activities.</li><li>From 2017 to 2020, criminal economic activity was <a href=\"https://www.cryptoforinnovation.org/resources/Analysis_of_Bitcoin_in_Illicit_Finance.pdf\">overwhelmingly conducted through traditional financial institutions</a>.</li></ul><h3>Myth #2: More illegal activity takes place using cryptocurrency than with\u00a0cash.</h3><p>The Facts:</p><ul><li>Good old-fashioned <a href=\"https://www.swift.com/sites/default/files/files/swift_bae_report_Follow-The%20Money.pdf\">cash</a> continues to be the funding of choice for criminals.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/financing/facti-interim-report.html\">The UN estimates </a>that ~$1.6 trillion in cash is laundered each\u00a0year</li><li>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets\">criminal activity</a> in cryptocurrency actually <em>fell </em>quite dramatically,<em> </em>from 2.1% in 2019 to less than half a percent in\u00a02020.</li><li>Despite the perceived appeal of cryptocurrency for money laundering, <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4400/RR4418/RAND_RR4418.pdf\">an estimated 99 percent of cryptocurrency transactions</a> are performed through centralized exchanges subject to the same AML/CFT regulations as traditional banks.</li></ul><h3>Myth #3: Cryptocurrency makes it harder for law enforcement to investigate malfeasance.</h3><p>The Facts:</p><ul><li>Crypto is easier to track because searchable public databases (blockchains) already exist for the majority of transactions. Even the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/page/file/1205051/download#page=170\">says\u00a0so</a>.</li><li>This gives law enforcement access to substantially more information than a case involving cash, including the date, time, and amount of the transaction, as well as the type of crypto used, the wallet address involved, and the unique transaction identifier (hash\u00a0value).</li><li>Once that data is recorded in the blockchain, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/02/01/can-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain-help-fight-corruption/\">it cannot be altered retroactively, there is little risk of data loss, and confidentiality is maintained</a>.</li><li>Immediately accessible with crypto, this kind of information can take law enforcement months or even years to obtain regarding cash transactions.</li></ul><p>This data is already paying dividends to law enforcement, who has teamed up with private analytics firms to analyze blockchain transactions <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao/page/file/1135861/download#page=251\">to identify individuals</a> involved in illicit finance and pursue investigations into <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/982821/download#page=21\">the dark web</a>, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/south-korean-national-and-hundreds-others-charged-worldwide-takedown-largest-darknet-child\">child exploitation</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1304276/download#page=10\">terrorist financing</a>.</p><p>These examples illustrate that crypto is not a haven for criminal activity or illicit financial dealings, but a medium for a wide range of secure, trackable transactions.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=856a71dfb399\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/fact-check-crypto-is-increasingly-being-used-for-criminal-activity-and-is-a-haven-for-illicit-856a71dfb399\">FACT CHECK: Crypto is increasingly being used for criminal activity and is a haven for illicit\u2026</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com\">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","title":"FACT CHECK: Crypto is increasingly being used for criminal activity and is a haven for illicit\u2026"},{"date":"Wed, 05 May 2021 21:02:39 +0000","image":{"href":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*TGH72Nnw24QL3iV9IOm4VA.png","link":"https://blog.coinbase.com?source=rss----c114225aeaf7---4","links":[{"href":"https://blog.coinbase.com?source=rss----c114225aeaf7---4","rel":"alternate","type":"text/html"}],"title":"The Coinbase Blog - Medium","title_detail":{"base":"","language":null,"type":"text/plain","value":"The Coinbase Blog - Medium"}},"link":"https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-transparency-report-h2-2020-b8ef1632c4dc?source=rss----c114225aeaf7---4","source":"The Coinbase Blog - Medium","summary":"<h3><strong>Coinbase Transparency Report\u200a\u2014\u200aH2\u00a02020</strong></h3><p><em>Coinbase is proud to publish our second Transparency Report, covering the period from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.

Cryptocurrency wallets are associated with two keys: a <em>secret</em> or <em>private</em> key, known only to the wallet holder, and a <em>public</em> key, known to the world.\u00b9 To send funds from a wallet, the wallet owner produces a valid <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\">digital signature</a>, which requires signing a message (a transaction in this case) with their private key. If a malicious party gains access to the private key, they could steal the wallet\u2019s funds. For most customers, Coinbase has the responsibility of protecting private keys to make sure funds remain secure and out of reach of attackers.</p><h3>Reusable Keys</h3><p>During key generation, we segment private keys into <em>shares </em>using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing\">Shamir Secret Sharing</a> (SSS) and delete the full key for extra security. Each share is held by a different party, and no individual party has full access to the private key. For a long time, there was one way to create a signature: reassemble private key shares to sign a transaction. Therefore, for our wallets to maintain the highest level of security, we only used an address once. If 1 BTC needed to be withdrawn from a key that stores 100 BTC, the remaining 99 BTC would be sent to a new private key during the withdrawal to ensure that we were not storing funds at a potentially vulnerable address.</p><p>However, one-time-use addresses have limits. In addition to the overhead required with continuing to generate keys, an even stronger need for securely reusing keys came along with cryptocurrency <a href=\"https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking/staking-on-coinbase#what-is-staking\">staking</a>. Staking generally requires multiple uses of a single long-term address. We needed a way to generate valid digital signatures without reconstructing the private\u00a0key.</p><p>Multiparty computation (MPC) saved the day. MPC protocols allow multiple parties to compute a function together, revealing no other information besides the output. Threshold signing, a specific use of MPC, permits individual parties to collaborate and produce a digital signature without reconstituting the original, composite private key. In practice, this means that rather than parties uploading their private key shares, they individually sign a transaction with their key share and upload a partial signature. These partial signatures\u00b2 are combined to create the valid signature, which is published to the blockchain.\u00b3 Key shares are never uploaded by parties nor combined, therefore maintaining the highest security while allowing keys to be\u00a0reused.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mdk9__tQ-AgCXTWQ\" /></figure><h3>Threshold Signing\u00a0Service</h3><p>We applied MPC to create Threshold Signing Service (TSS). Different cryptocurrency assets use different digital signatures algorithms. We will focus the rest of this article on the TSS protocol for Ed25519 signatures. There are five phases for this protocol:</p><ul><li><strong>Party Key Generation</strong>. Creates long-term public and private keys in a trusted environment for parties who will participate in signing. Each party\u2019s private keys are loaded onto <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module\">Hardware Security Modules</a> (HSMs), which prevent anyone from using the private keys without physical access to the\u00a0HSM.</li><li><strong>Key Generation</strong>. Creates a set of TSS keys and divides the keys using SSS. Uses the public keys produced in party key generation to encrypt each signing key share to the party who will receive\u00a0it.</li><li><strong>Nonce Generation</strong>. Round 1 of 2 of the signing protocol. Participants in this round generate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce\">nonce</a> values and send them to all other\u00a0parties.</li><li><strong>Partial Sign</strong>. Round 2 of 2 of the signing protocol. Participants use the nonce shares received from other parties and their signing key share to generate partial signatures.</li><li><strong>Generate Final Signature. </strong>Combine partial signatures into the final\u00a0result.</li></ul><p>The first two phases occur rarely (once in the lifetime of a signing key). The final three phases repeat every time a transaction, which we call a <em>message</em>, is signed. The next section takes a technical deep dive into the signing phases of the protocol.Ed25519 Signatures</p><p>The method for generating a digital signature for an Ed25519 key is as follows: Ed25519 is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA\">EdDSA signature</a> scheme that is parameterized to SHA-512 and Curve25519. For <a href=\"https://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/\">elliptic curves</a>, <em>G</em> is the base point and <em>q</em> is the base point order. Given a message <em>m</em> to be signed and a private key <em>k</em>, a signature is produced as\u00a0follows:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kFPTeG5hMw86czGvh2H66g.png\" /></figure><p>Our threshold signing protocol is an adaptation of the threshold Schnorr signature scheme by <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Revisiting-the-Distributed-Key-Generation-for-Based-Gennaro-Jarecki/642bd1bbc86c7750cef9fa770e9e4ba86bd49eb9?p2df\">Gennaro, Jarecki, Krawczyk, and\u00a0Rabin.</a></p><p>In the protocol, participants generate both the nonce<em> r</em> and signature <em>s </em>in a distributed fashion without reconstituting the underlying private key. In Round 1, participants produce and distribute nonce shares <em>r\u1d62</em>. In Round 2, participants compute the composite nonce <em>r </em>from the nonce shares <em>r\u1d62</em> and produce partial signatures <em>s\u1d62</em>, which the server combines to produce the composite signature <em>s</em>. The final signature is identical to the signature which would be produced by combining secret shares and signing the original message with the composite private\u00a0key.</p><h3>Nonce Generation</h3><p>In Round 1, participants use the message <em>m </em>and the key share <em>k\u1d62 </em>to do the following</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VxfRsWrZO1-dSEhkU0TuTg.png\" /></figure><p>After <em>t</em> participants have completed the nonce generation, signing\u00a0begins.</p><h3>Nonce Aggregation</h3><p>After <em>t</em> nonces have been posted, participants perform Round 2 by aggregating the nonce shares to derive the composite nonce. Each participant <em>i </em>performs:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LpXZl0ZXnpovRzIS7YVzRg.png\" /></figure><h3>Partial Signatures</h3><p>Participants create partial signatures\u2074, which can be combined to generate the signature <em>s</em>.</p><p>Each participant <em>i</em> performs:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kdGIO4RMy5XM6R5X8CpnBg.png\" /></figure><h3>Signature Aggregation</h3><p>Finally, the server aggregates components into signature that can be verified with public key\u00a0<em>K</em>.</p><p>Below is an example that combines two partial signatures without Shamir\u00a0sharing:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iijXijsjhkeZii3Z9t0I0A.png\" /></figure><p>As long as the challenge, <em>c</em>, is the same for both signatures, the nonce and private key shares behave linearly under addition. Due to this property, we can apply the standard Shamir\u2019s reconstruction to the <em>s\u1d62 </em>values to construct <em>s</em>:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*etnzZ1Jkb36w6UUjwdmB9A.png\" /></figure><p>This result, along with nonce public key <em>R</em>, is a valid signature. The server verifies the signature (<em>R</em>, <em>s</em>) using message <em>m</em> and public key <em>K</em> and checks the nonce value <em>R</em> has not been previously used.</p><h3>From Concept to Production</h3><p>Deploying a production-level system involves solving for certain real-world problems. For example, getting attention from human participants can take a long time (on the order of hours). Since the protocol supports human participants, we run the risk of delaying transaction approval for too long. For example, the cryptocurrency Algorand has a short validation time: just a few hours. If we cannot compute a signature over a transaction in this time frame, partial progress must be discarded. Two of our design decisions help reduce the burden for humans approving transactions: 1. Rounds are asynchronous, meaning participants do not have to participate at the same exact time, and 2. Each round requires a threshold of parties, but both rounds do not require the same set of participants to participate.</p><p>Another challenge is the issue of storing secret information, since the devices used to store key shares and participate in the signing protocol could be lost or broken. This led to a model where parties are relatively <em>stateless</em>: the only state they have is a small amount of long term storage on HSMs, which are highly secure, portable, and durable. Participants in the signing protocol do not communicate with each other: a centralized server stores all artifacts, such as nonce shares and partial signatures. A natural concern to come up is what happens if a centralized server is compromised\u200a\u2014\u200awe investigate this threat and other threat models in the following section.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>TSS has two primary security\u00a0goals:</p><ol><li>Without the private key, an attacker should not be able to generate a valid signature over an unauthorized message. This is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature_forgery#Existential_forgery_(existential_unforgeability,_EUF)\"><strong>existential unforgeability</strong></a> under adaptive chosen message attack and is the expected security for a digital signature scheme.</li><li><strong>Private key privacy </strong>after the key generation ceremony. This should protect against an attacker who has access to some (less than threshold <em>t</em>) private key\u00a0shares.</li></ol><p>Below are some attacks we considered and defenses we created for selected threat\u00a0models.</p><p><strong><em>Server Trust.</em></strong><em> </em>The centralized server transfers messages between participants.</p><ul><li><strong>Attack:</strong> Unauthorized access to data. <br /><strong>Defense</strong>: All secret data uploaded to the server must be encrypted to the intended participant. The server has no access to private keys, so cannot access data in the messages it\u00a0relays.</li><li><strong>Attack:</strong> Manipulation of data. <br /><strong>Defense</strong>: Participants validate every piece of data provided by the server, and halt the protocol if they detect data modification.</li><li><strong>Attack: </strong>Data loss. <br /><strong>Defense</strong>: Data from key generation ceremonies are backed up through our disaster-recovery processes (not discussed in detail here) and can be recovered in the case of server data\u00a0loss.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Participant Trust</em>. </strong>Participants hold onto key shares and participate in the signing protocol.</p><ul><li><strong>Attack:</strong> Individual participant performing existential forgery.<br /><strong>Defense</strong>: Participants have the critical responsibility of validating data provided by the server. Any participant can abort the protocol and trigger incident response procedures if malicious activity is detected.</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: Participants colluding to perform existential forgery. <br /><strong>Defense</strong>: Since any single participant can halt the protocol if they detect malicious activity, the protocol requiring t participants <em>remains secure with up to t\u200a\u2014\u200a1 malicious participants</em>. An additional protection against collusion is supporting a hybrid participant model: a combination of humans and servers. We use weighted secret sharing to ensure that every signing requires participation from both human and server participants. This further increases the barrier for compromising <em>t</em> participants.</li><li><strong>Attack: </strong>Nonce Reuse<em>. </em>A well-known attack for Schnorr-style signatures is using the same nonce multiple times on different messages. This leads to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature#Key_leakage_from_nonce_reuse\">trivial recovery of private keys</a>, compromising our second security goal and opening the door for an immediate loss of funds. <br /><strong>Defense</strong>: Nonce shares encode information about the message, making it simple to detect nonce reuse upon decryption. Having a two-round protocol allows participants to authenticate nonce shares in Round 2 and abort if they detect nonce\u00a0reuse.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Key Issuer Trust</em>.</strong> The key issuer generates private keys and distributes key\u00a0shares.</p><ul><li><strong>Attack: </strong>Exfiltrating secrets from a key generation ceremony. <br /><strong>Defense</strong>: The process of generating keys is a fully documented and audited process, which requires that all plaintext of keys are destroyed before the culmination of the key generation ceremony.</li></ul><p>Through this threat modeling, we see that a malicious entity needs to compromise a threshold of participants to have any chance of stealing funds. We carefully calibrate the human and server participant thresholds with this in mind to ensure that our funds maintain the highest level of security.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>TSS for signing payloads over the Ed25519 curve is an elegant and simple service: it takes as input a message payload and produces a valid signature, after a series of signers interact with the two-round protocol. This service provides a solution for reusing cold keys without bringing them online. Through translating a full cryptographic protocol to a real life service, we created TSS, the first production-level threshold signing service in existence to secure billions of dollars in\u00a0assets.</p><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><ol><li>More precisely, the public key is used to derive the wallet\u2019s address, which is known to the\u00a0public.</li><li>that are invalid in isolation</li><li>The blockchain does not have to be aware of nor support special logic for threshold signatures, since the signature created is the <em>same </em>signature created using the composite private\u00a0key.</li><li>Using the message as associated data for encryption. This ensures that this nonce can only be used for signing this message. This defends against nonce-replay attacks that lead to private key recovery.</li></ol><p><em>Read more about </em><a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/careers/cryptography\"><em>Cryptography at Coinbase</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you are interested in the complexity of applying threshold cryptography, </em><a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/careers/positions/2676392\"><em>Coinbase is hirin</em></a><em>g Cryptographers </em>and<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/careers?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mt_i_m_w_m_m_med_blo_0_TSS\"><em>Software Engineers.</em></a></p><p><em>This website contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).
