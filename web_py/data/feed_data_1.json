South Korea and Thailand have reported record infections, with the Japanese capital Tokyo likely to see a surge in cases as the Olympics gets underway. Efforts across many regions to curb the virus spread has dampened high expectations about demand for things like travel and tourism etc. </p><p>The only positive spin one can put on this in so far as equities are concerned is that it will help QE tapering by central banks. And that could be one of the reasons why we have seen the markets rebound over the past couple of days. Another reason is the generally supportive corporate earnings that we have seen so far.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jul/21/uk-borrowing-june-economy-reopened-interest-payments-ftse-sterling-stock-markets-business-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jul/21/uk-borrowing-june-economy-reopened-interest-payments-ftse-sterling-stock-markets-business-live", "date": "Wed, 21 Jul 2021 12:36:04 +0000", "source_url": "https://theguardian.com/uk/rss"}, {"title": "RT @OneOfNFT: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen nothing yet of what\u2019s possible...\u201d @amberjae93 said at last weeks @ChristiesInc Art + Tech Summit.
